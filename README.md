RecoveryAssistant v1.0: AI-Driven Post-Op Monitoring
RecoveryAssistant is a proactive monitoring engine that utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to analyze real-time patient vital signs. By shifting from reactive binary alarms to a probabilistic risk assessment, it identifies complex patterns of clinical deterioration—such as rising heart rate paired with falling oxygen—to significantly reduce alert fatigue. The solution features a Next.js dashboard and a Flask backend, providing clinicians with high-level clarity through a 94% accurate model probability score and automated risk-factor highlighting.
